# MachineLearningProject : Analysis of IRIS Dataset and MNIST Dataset using Decision Trees and MLP


This project utilizes the SKLEARN module to analyze the IRIS Dataset and the MNIST Dataset using decision trees and MLP (Multi-Layer Perceptron). The goal is to classify the data and demonstrate the effectiveness of these machine learning algorithms in solving classification problems.
